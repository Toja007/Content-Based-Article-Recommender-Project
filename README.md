Content-Based Article Recommender Project

Overview
This project aims to develop a content-based article recommender system. Unlike collaborative filtering methods, which rely on user behavior and preferences, content-based recommendation focuses on the characteristics of the items and users' past interactions. In this case, the system recommends articles based on their content and the user's historical interactions with similar articles.

Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Scikit-learn

Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing information about articles, such as id, url, title, subtitle, image, claps, responses, reading time, publication, 'date'. The dataset should be preprocessed and cleaned before use. The sample dataset can be found in the data directory.

Preprocessing
1.	Text Cleaning: Remove any special characters, or irrelevant symbols from the article content.
2.	Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words (tokens).
3.	Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words (e.g., "and," "the") that do not contribute much to content understanding.
4.	Stemming or Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form to improve feature extraction.
Feature Extraction
Transform the processed text data into numerical features. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.

Model Building
1.	Cosine Similarity: Calculate the cosine similarity between articles based on their feature vectors.
2.	Recommendation Algorithm: Implement a recommendation algorithm that identifies articles with high similarity to the user's preferences.

Future Improvements
•	Incorporate user feedback to enhance the recommendation system over time.
•	Explore advanced natural language processing techniques for better feature extraction.
•	Implement user interface for better interaction.
